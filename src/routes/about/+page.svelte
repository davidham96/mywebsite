            My first experience with programming was in 2018 with a very basic
            intro to Python, however this didn't last as I was too focused on
            getting into medical school. 3 years later, I realized medicine
            wouldn't be for me, and came back to Python, as a full beginner once
            more. After 2 years majoring in Physiology, I decided that
            programming would suit me better, so I switched majors. My
            goals/interests however haven't changed all that much; to help those
            with mental health problems. Mental health plagues the maternal side
            of family, and it's something I am willing to work hard towards to
            alleviate. I am thus interested in the future use of programming to
            try to solve issues such as depression, dementia, if ever possible.
