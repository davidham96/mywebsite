            My first experience with programming was in 2018 with a very basic
            intro to Python, however this didn't last long as I was focused on
            getting better grades in hopes of going to medical school. After 2
            years of majoring in Physiology with a high GPA, and achieving a
            high score on the CASPer test, I realized that medical school would
            not be for me. I decided that programming would suit me better, so I
            switched majors and relearned basic programming concepts (mostly in
            Python, Java). My interests however haven't changed all that much;
            to help those with mental health problems. Mental health
            unfortunately deeply affects the maternal side of family (notably
            depression, dementia) and has even lead to loss of life in some
            cases. I am thus interested in the future use of programming to try
            to help alleviate such issues.
