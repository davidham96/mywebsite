            My first experience with programming was in 2018 with a very basic
            intro to Python, however this didn't last long as I was focused on
            getting better grades in hopes of going to medical school. After 2
            years of majoring in Physiology with a solid GPA, and achieving a
            high score on the CASPer test, I realized that medical school would
            not be for me. I decided that programming would suit me better, so I
            switched majors and relearned basic programming concepts (mostly in
            Python and Java).
